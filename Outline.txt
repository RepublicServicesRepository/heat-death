Outline

Intro - talk about the main points 
    Code Complexity - What is it and why its important runtime vs cyclomatic
    Heat Death of the Universe - Limits of current computing and how NP and P work
    Route Sequencing and Traveling Salesmen - Talk about implimentation of ESRI sequencing stop

Code COomplexity - cyclomatic
    Control Flow
    All possibilities code can traverse - linerally independent paths the code can traverse

Code Complexity - Runtime - different solutions as developers we use to solve problems SOLUTION FOCUSED
    Very Brief talk on code notation and how it works from a math perspective
        big O and graphs of code
        Time it takes to complete vs the size of the input
        Worse case, approaching highest term
        Data size 
        Operations
        Make sure to mention n!
        O(1) constant
        O(log n)
        O(n) linear 
        O(nlogn)
        O(n^2) quadratic
        _________________________
        O(2^n) exponential
        O(n!) factorial

        Decision problems - exploring the common problems faces by developers and their perceived execution time PROBLEM FOCUSED
     P vs NP - a proof verifying one way or another carries $1M prize Milleninum Price problems
        P = NP - Does this mean being able to quickly verify an answer indicate there has to be a as quick method to iterate a solution
        p != np - NP cant be solved in Poly but can be verified - 


        Polynomial - Decision problems that can be solved via a deterministic  sequence in polynomial time to the size of the input -
             reasonably fast multiplication or sorting a list of names, mazes


        nondeterministic polynomial - decisions problems that can be verified in polynomial time - can be checked in a reasonable amount of time
                Vehicle Routing Job Scheduling, finding primes SAT
        Example - Sudoku - can be difficult to solve but very quick to verify
            As the grid gets larger, human verification grows polynomial where the alogrithms grow exponentionally 

        NP-Complete - transformable to complete in polynomial? The hardest part of NP problems
            Operations Research - integer programming and the traveling salesmen problem, protein structure prediction, knapsack?

        OUTSIDE NP - if a chess move is the correct move or not

        EXPTIME - exponential running time - moves in chess, checkers and go
        Undecidable problems (Halting) - 
        Can not be solved by any algorithm,
         one input that will not produce a valid answwer, 
         finish execution with no answer, or run until the heat death.

        Traveling Salesmen and Vehicle Routing

            Esri solution
            ~200 routes for effenciency 
            Resequence routes within a geofence of the perm routes
            Nearest Neighbor other non-perm routes

        deterministic and sequential

Talk about cyclomatic complexity?
    Nested conditions
